        How much does it <span>cost to ship a car per mile?</span>
      </h1>
      <p className={ResponsiveTableCss.description}>
        The average <strong>cost to ship a car</strong> is indirectly
        proportionate to the distance a car needs to be shipped. Letâ€™s say if
        the vehicle needs to be transported up to 500 miles, then the average
        cost is slightly above $1. As the distance increases and it goes up to
        1000 miles, the average cost decreases to $0.75 per mile.
